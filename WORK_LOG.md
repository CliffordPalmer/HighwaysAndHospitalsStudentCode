I figured out that for each cluster of cities, if hospitals are more expensive than roads, then each cluster should have one hospital and a bunch of roads. If roads are more expensive, each city should have a hospital. Stared coding and decided to make a City class which keeps track of neighbors |

I'm now trying to split the cities into clusters so that I can easily run the strategy discussed above. This is really difficult to do however. I'm trying to used BFS to create the clusters. |

I worked on figuring out BFS, and am not pretty close to a working solution. Need to iron out a few small bugs. |
| September 12 |  7:30-8:45  | ALMOST THERE. I have some really hidden bug that makes me fail on ONLY testVeryLarge, which I'm finding very difficult to debug. The good news is that the discrepancy is eaxctly the difference between the price of a highway and hospoital, so I must be adding a highway somewhere instead of a city. The bad news is I have no clue where that issue is happening. Also, the large efficiency test times out every time. I might try changing everything to arrays instead of arraylists in order to speed things up, but I don't know how to make the run time scale a a slower rate yet. Also, my last commit got a little messed up, so this commit is for both this work period and yesterdays. |

Still a little confused on the whole union-search concept. |

The first thing that's throwing me off is the fact that the pairs in cities aren't in order, when ideally they are in order for my algorithm to work. I'm also just getting other issues that I don't really know the reason for. I'll often end up with random roots which mess with the final calculation.  |
