| April 5      |   9-10pm    |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       I tried to write abstract, efficient code. |
| September 10 | 8:35-9:05pm | Thought about how to solve the problem. I figured out that for each cluster of cities, if hospitals are more expensive than roads, then each cluster should have one hospital and a bunch of roads. If roads are more expensive, each city should have a hospital. Stared coding and decided to make a City class which keeps track of neighbors |

I'm now trying to split the cities into clusters so that I can easily run the strategy discussed above. This is really difficult to do however. I'm trying to used BFS to create the clusters. |

I worked on figuring out BFS, and am not pretty close to a working solution. Need to iron out a few small bugs. |
